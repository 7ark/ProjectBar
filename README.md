# The Bar

As a bartender, you’re responsible for serving drinks to various unique races without accidentally poisoning them; while also dealing with different moral scenarios throughout the game that will affect the world you’re a part of.

## Introduction
The Bar is my latest game I'm working on, which I intend to keep the code open source for everyone. You can see some of my past work
on my [website.](http://corykoseck.com) 

My plans for the game are still developing along with the game. I have a general idea sketched out (mostly in my head) about how I want the
game to be presented. I've gotten a lot of ideas and inspiration from the game [Papers Please by Lucas Pope](http://papersplea.se/), if you haven't tried that game I
would definitely suggest you give it a go.

## Art Style
I don't have a solid grasp on how I want the art to look yet, but in my head it's pixel art, very simplistic. Similar examples may include
'Papers Please' and 'The Red Strings Club'.

## Game Premise
The premise of the game is that you're this bartender in a fantasy world that has multiple unique races. Similar to how many stories have dwarves
and elves, except I wanted to attempt to create my own races in this world. These different races can be vastly different, especially
in what they can or cannot drink. So as a bartender in this world, it's a standard that you're actually responsible for determining what
may or may not kill a customer. Accidental poisonings are semi-common, though of course that doesn't do well for business.

So when a customer comes in, your job is mainly to not accidentally poison that customer. To do this you'll be equiped with a journal that
gives you information about these different races, it will inform you about what beverages can poison a particular race. You'll need to use
this to keep customers coming in; if too many people are dying who's going to want to drink at your bar?

Additionally just serving the customer something that won't kill them won't be enough, you'll need to talk to each customer that comes in
to figure out what they want to drink. This will be done with various conversation topics you'll be able to choose to try to get info from
the customer. If you're successful, you'll find yourself with a heafty tip at the end of the day.
Serving a customer well will keep them coming back to be a returning customer, and keep money flowing.

Similar to Papers Please, at the end of the day you'll have different expenses. Rent, perhaps a family, restocking your supplies, etc.
I haven't currently put too much thought into the details of this feature.

The other major feature are the moral scenarios you'll encounter. You will have normal customers coming in for a drink, 
but once or twice a day (maybe even three times) you'll have some special encounters. These will be special scenarios where you'll have
to make moral choices.
Some examples. Someone might come into your bar, requesting you "accidentally" poison someone who would be coming into the bar later; if 
you do this he'll give you a very large tip for compensation. You could have a man come into your bar with an unknown woman, then the next
day he returns with his wife; will you tell her or accept his bribe to stay quiet?

Besides these day to day scenarios, there will also be an overarching story about the country you live in. Your window to the outside world
will be a newspaper informing you of changes to the country, along with your bar window to see outside. These world events can change how
you operate your bar, like if a new drink is no longer banned, or a certain race is now allowed into the country you must account for 
and learn about.

## Information
This game is a work in progress, all the art I'm using is randomly found online. You can find some ramblings and quick notes I'm keeping
in a google doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qoM2zUBoNPjeZzWR8vnAt8jV5L2XKSCoHWUKirlp3Lw/edit?usp=sharing).

I've also been posting GIFs and images to my [Twitter @The7ark](https://twitter.com/the7ark).
